C200-Camera-Driver
==================
The LibUSB 1.0 library should be installed before running this code.

The Bash Script 'run.sh' has the command to create the executable.

Running that script will create the executable for the c200_camera.c code

The complete code flow is documented in the c200_camera.h file
